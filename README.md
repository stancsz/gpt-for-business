GPT for Business -  Harnessing the Power of Artificial Intelligence for Maximum Profit

This project is an experiment in using natural language processing prompts to write a book on a complex topic. The goal is to see if it is possible to use NLP to generate coherent and informative text on a complex subject, and to explore the potential benefits and limitations of this approach. The project will involve creating a series of prompts, training a language model on those prompts, and then using the model to generate text for the book. The final result will be evaluated for coherence, accuracy, and readability, and the findings will be used to share with other NLP-based writing projects.
